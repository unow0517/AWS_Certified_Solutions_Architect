## Key Concepts
**S3 Transfer Acceleration**
  1. This feature utilizes Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations to speed up uploads to S3.
  2. Benefit: It significantly reduces the time it takes to upload large volumes of data from geographic locations.

**CloudFront**
  1. Amazon CloudFront is a globally distributed Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that accelerates the delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs to users. It works by caching copies of content at edge locations around the world, allowing users to access data from the nearest geographical location, thereby reducing latency.

**S3 Cross-Region Replication**
  1. feature that automatically replicates data stored in one Amazon S3 bucket to another S3 bucket in a different AWS region. This replication helps enhance data durability, availability, and compliance by ensuring that data is stored across multiple geographic locations.

**AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized**
  1. a highly versatile, portable storage and compute device used for transferring large amounts of data in and out of AWS. Designed to handle petabyte-scale data transfers.
  2. Provides up to 80 TB of usable storage capacity.
